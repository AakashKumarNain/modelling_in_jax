## Motivation

This repository is your guide to mastering **pure JAX** for building scalable ML models without any third-party frameworks. You'll learn to create minimal yet powerful abstractions that can efficiently run on massive accelerator clusters.

### Objectives

- 🔧 **Pure JAX Implementation**: Build models using only JAX primitives—no external ML libraries
- 🏗️ **Minimal Abstractions**: Design clean, scalable patterns for distributed training
- 📚 **Complement JAX Scaling**: Enhance your knowledge from the official JAX scaling documentation
- 🤖 **(M)LLM Focus**: Apply these patterns specifically to (MultiModal) Large Language Models


## Target Audience

This repository is designed for:
- 🧠 **Expert ML Engineers** who is already aware of building models in PyTorch or JAX, but want more depth
- 🔬 **ML Researchers** who are eager to try building models in JAX
- 🏃‍♂️ **Performance Engineers** optimizing for scale
- 💡 **Anyone** seeking deep understanding of JAX's capabilities

## Table of Contents

I work on this project in my free time between my day job, personal research, staying current with papers, and contributing to open source. Progress will be steady but unhurried. Here is the list of things we will cover:

### Core Concepts
